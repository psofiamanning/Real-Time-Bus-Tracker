# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
## Description
By using the free API that Mapbox provides to get access to maps, a map of Boston appears. A a marker is added that moves along the bus stations that go from MIT to Harvard. In order to make the marker move, a button to initiate the action is also included at the top of the page, called "Show stops between MIT and Harvard".

## What's included?
This repository includes 3 files:
1. index.html - where the javascript code and css styles code of Mapbox are called. It also calls the mapanimation.js file
2. mapanimation.js - has the formulas that allow the marker in the map to move throughout the bus stops
3. styles.css - has the styles of the html file

## Future improvements
1. A button to make the bus marker stop at any time (September 2022)
2. Different style of the map (September 2022)
3. A box showing the name of the bus stop, as it passes by each one of them (October 2022)
